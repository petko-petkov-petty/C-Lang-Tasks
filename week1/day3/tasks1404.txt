task1
    print number as hexadecimal without using %x and % operator
        example: 
            0   -> 0x0
            12  -> 0xC
            255 -> 0xFF

task2
    create function <rotate> that swaps the first and the last bit, the first+1 and the last-1 bit, and so on
    so that it creates the mirror image of the binary representation of the input number
        example:
            rotate(11) == 13
            1011 -> 1101
